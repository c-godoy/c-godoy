<h2>Hello! 👋🏼 </h2>
Welcome to my Github Repository. <br> 
In this space you will find some of my automation codes, that I develop in my free time, while I study new languages and frameworks. <br>
This is my safe space to test, create and make mistakes. <br>
Feel free to take a look, you can ask me if you have any doubts about my codes.
